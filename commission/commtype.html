<h1>Pricing</h1><hr />
These are base prices! There may be surcharges based on complexity of the subject. If such is the case, I will bring it up with you. Thank you for understanding.
<br /><br />
If desired, flats can come with a slight gradient to it.
<br /><br />
Commissions with flats or shading may include a simple background (eg. gradients, geometric shapes, etc).
