<h1>Pricing</h1><hr />
All prices are in USD! If your design is very complex I have a right to add $5 to the price, thank you for understanding.
<br /><br />
What's the difference between colored sketches and actual lined drawings? Lined art will be cleaner and have more polish to it.
<br /><br />
Colored orders may include a simple background (eg. gradients, geometric shapes, etc).
