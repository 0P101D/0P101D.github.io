Oliver is really a mystery. A question. Few know who he was and who he is. Well, he knows, at least.
<br /><br />
If you knew the right place to look, you <i>could</i> piece together a few things, but that place is across the continent. Of German-Russian descent, Oliver is older than he appears. His real birth certificate states that he was born in 1979. It can be inferred he discovered his power in his teens, preserving his age. His family, like him, were involved in the Russian Mafia. His activities lead him to station in Hong Kong, while studying Heroes. However, he's done his work to cover that up.
<br /><br />
On government documents in Hong Kong, he was born in 1996. He immigrated in 2012 for the purpose of school, and was enrolled into Shen Hua Academy as a 1st year. He is also the child of a rather wealthy family. Not that these points were entirely false...

His interest was immediately piqued when the Anti-Hero Society's grand entrance into the public eye. He quickly found his way into the group.
