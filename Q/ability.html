<ul><li>returns the state of an object/being to a state it had in the past</li>
  <li>(apparent age is a side effect of this skill)</li>
  <li>Not AOE. If selecting multiple objects, time required is added together and activation is based on all objects as a whole.
    <ul><li>For example, it’d pretty much be impossible to reverse the state of a burned house even if you were there within minutes of the accident, because things like pipes/etc. Are counted as another object. (an object broken into several pieces however still counts as one object)</li></ul></li>
  <li>cast: telekinesis/mental focus (farther and/or larger = more mental effort put into cast, usually translating as taking longer to activate.)</li>
  <li>30 second cooldown between each cast</li>
  <li>Is not an omnipotent skill that can read the past. Though the user is able to identify the different states within the last 24 hours, they can't see why; they just “sense” a difference.</li>
  <li>Reversal of time also requires time.
    <ul><li>system works based off of nonphysical “charges”</li>
      <li>there are 12 charges total. the more charges are on a single target, the faster it'll take to reverse.</li>
      <li>boost is not linear. If an object is returning to its state 6 hours ago, one charge will make it take 6 hours to return to that state. If two, it will take 3. If three, it’ll take 2, and so on.</li>
      <li>Multiple charges can be attached per casting. (It is more time and energy efficient to put exactly the number of charges you want the first cast…)</li>
      <li>charges can function without direct user control, but cannot be recalled. Once the task is completed, the charge automatically returns to the caster regardless of if they want to reverse further or not</li>
      <li>if all charges are occupied, skill cannot be used</li></ul></li>
  <li>The time of which the object was in the state cannot be longer than 24 hours back. (The time during which it is reversed are not factored into this requirement.)</li>
  <li>skill can be used to “reverse” to a state before the last “reversion”<ul>
      <li>ex: If you had a broken pot, you could return it to its state when it wasn't broken. After that, if you really wanted to you could reverse it to the time before the last time you reversed.</li>
      <li>you can think of it as like, backup versions of a file.</li>
      <li>Can reverse wounds. cannot reverse a state of death. Organic objects will also be counted as different “parts” based on their which system they belong in. After a battle, the amount of time taken to restore skin is different from the amount taken to restore a finger, etc. (and it would really be impossible to try something like reversing an entire human body)</li></ul></li>
