In short, Oliver's ability allows him to <b>revert objects to a previous state</b>.
<br /><br />
Cast with mental focus, an object's state can be reversed. This 'reversal' is real-time; if reverting to a state 10 seconds ago, it will take 10 seconds to occur.
<br /><br />
His ability works off of a multiplier/point system, of sorts. Oliver has a maximum 12 'points' total. Upon casting, an object has 1 point attached to it. By casting multiple times, Oliver is able to add more charges to it, which <b>speeds up</b> the process. 4 charges would make the object revert 4x as fast.
<br /><br />
For comparison, if an object were to be reverted to its state 6 hours ago, 1 point would make it take six hours. 2 points would take three hours. 3 points would take two hours, 4 takes an hour and a half, and so on.
<br /><br />
Once the effect is cancelled (something that Oliver has to mentally call to do so), the used points are destroyed. A point can take upwards <b>two hours</b> to regenerate, scaled nonlinearly in accordance to how much time was 'reversed'. (This number is also affected by Oliver's physical health.) It is important to note that he only needs to call for its <i>cancellation</i>; the skill, once cast, can work without Oliver's immediate presence, and will run automatically.
<br /><br />
An object cannot be reverted to a state past 24 hours of the moment the skill was cast. An object must be relatively undisturbed during the process; if you were to kick an object in the middle of reversal, it will cancel the effects prematurely.
<br /><br />
This skill can also be cast on organic objects, and so can be used to mend/reopen physical wounds. If used on such, it needs to be resting; if you try to revert a deep cut on an arm, it will cancel if the person tries to use the arm with some effort. (In addition, if blood is flowing openly, it will also disturb the process.) Also note that the ability <b>cannot revert memories</b>.
<br /><br />
Though usually thought of for fixing things, it's important to note that it can reverse repair, as well; if you for example put together a scale model kit, the ability could reverse that and take it all back apart. (That being said, after reversing that, it can also reverse to it being put together again; you can <b>undo an undo</b>.)
